Before provisioning EC2 servers
===============================

1)

export BOTO_CONFIG=~/.aws/credentials

That file should look like:

[Credentials]
aws_access_key_id = blahblah
aws_secret_access_key = blahblahblahblah

2)

Create an SSH public/private key pair called 'ec2ansible' in your ~/.ssh directory:
   ssh-keygen RET ec2ansible RET RET
